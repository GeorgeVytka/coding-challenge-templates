# Important please read
 You are required to dockerize your application for us to run your submission. The following templates are available for you to use for your submission. Feel free to use these templates or you may submit your challenge with your own dockerized services (more brownie points!).

 Please read through this README closely as it may have important information to assist you on your coding challenge adventure!

# Installing Docker
You are required to install docker on your system. Please follow this [link](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to get your installation package for Docker 

Docker does a great job running you through on how to install docker on OSX, Windows or Linux based OS.

Once you installed Docker and this is your first time using it, we recommend you to go through the 2 minute tutorial found here:

https://docs.docker.com/get-started/#start-the-tutorial

# Using our templates
We recommend to you to download the repository as a ZIP and extract out any of the templated projects to your own workspace.
